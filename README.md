#### 👩‍💻 My Contribution

In this project, I was responsible for developing the **Covers section** — a responsive gallery with a smooth diagonal scrolling animation.

### What I did

- Built the HTML structure for the gallery with semantic and clean markup.  
- Styled the section using CSS, including responsive layout and the diagonal scrolling effect.  
- Added support for high-quality images.  
- Wrote JavaScript logic to:
  - Duplicate gallery elements for continuous scrolling  
  - Start animations only when the section appears on screen (using Intersection Observer)

This section adds movement and visual interest to the website while remaining lightweight and user-friendly.

I was responsible for implementing the covers section of the project. This section displays a dynamic, responsive photo gallery of project covers with a continuous diagonal scroll animation.

From a technical perspective:

I developed the HTML structure and ensured semantic accessibility.

I styled the section using CSS, including responsive layout, custom diagonal scroll animations, and high-DPI image support.

I implemented JavaScript logic to:

Duplicate gallery elements for seamless infinite scrolling.

Trigger animations using the Intersection Observer API when the section comes into view.

The result is a performant and visually engaging element that enhances the user experience across devices.
